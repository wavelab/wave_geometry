# Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/wavelab/wave_geometry/compare/0.3.0..HEAD)
### New features
- `dynamic` module with heap-allocated, dynamically-composable `Proxy` expressions
- `estimation` module with uncertain objects and noise models
- N-ary expressions
- `Point` expressions representing true 3D affine points. Unlike translations, points
  cannot be added or scaled.
- Documentation built with Sphinx

### Backward-incompatible API changes
- C++17 is now required
- Boost 1.58 is now required
- CMake 3.8 is now required
- Changed selection of storage types from expression types.
  (Described in docs under "Storage and auto")
- `CompactRigidTransform` stored as separate quaternion and vector instead of 7-vector.
  Changed template parameters.

### Fixes and minor changes
- Fixed finding googletest source package on Ubuntu bionic
- Fixed (trivial) reverse-mode AD on a single leaf
- Moved numerical Jacobian evaluator into `core` module
- Reorganized and renamed storage base classes
- .translation() and .rotation() methods work on all transform expressions (not just leaves)
- Faster exponential map to quaternions
- `Subtract` expression represents subtraction, replacing combination of sum and negation.
- Improved error message on trying to construct a Framed object from a mismatching expression.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/wavelab/wave_geometry/compare/0.2.0...0.3.0) (2018-08-19)
### New features
- Scalar multiplication (scalar\*vector, vector\*scalar, and vector\/scalar)
- Differentiable arithmetic operations on scalar expressions (e.g. ```v1.norm() + v2.norm()`)
- The library can be installed and used via CMake
- The library can be built as a submodule of libwave
- Automated CI builds

### Deprecated support
- C++11 support is deprecated. The next release will use C++17.
- Eigen 3.2.92 (3.3-beta2) is not officially supported. It works as of this release, but
only 3.3.7 is tested in CI.

### Fixes and minor changes
- Expressions can be differentiated w.r.t. their stored contents
  (e.g. `auto expr = v * 2; expr.jacobian(expr.rhs())`)
- CMake handling of dependencies improved
- Minor bug and compiler warning fixes

## 0.2.0 (2018-05-04)

Initial public release. Previously, wave_geometry was under development as a library
called `lkinematics`.
